## Folders

[meeting_notes](meeting_notes): rough notes coming after each session, feel free to add/edit/comment

[papers-marked-up-and-comment-files](papers-marked-up-and-comment-files): Pdfs of papers stored here; with notes and comments (?)  
- BUT see [hypothesis](#Hypothesis-shared-annotations) shared annotations below

Any shared 'developed' material could be put here.


## Hypothesis shared annotations 

I (David Reinstein) suggest that we all get an account for the [Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/) tool, and install the browser/bookmark add-in. This tool is great (and free and nonprofit)! It takes less than 5 minutes to install and learn, and I guarantee you will start using it all the time. (I have no association with this company, I just like the tool). 

- We can then leave comments and ask questions *directly on any hosted web page on the internet, including the journal articles themselves.*
   - [Below](#Papers-and-tools-with-hosted-sites-to-add-our-comments) I give a list of the papers with open-access (?) hosts where we can leave our comments/notes/questions

- I suggest leaving your comments/notes with the tag "ml-reading-group" (no 'hash sign' needed). Then we can look up each others' comments *anywhere* on the internet. 

- I suggest leaving these as *public* comments; down the road we may be able to engage experts and even the original authors in this. 

- It allows math notation etc
